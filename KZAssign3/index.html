                      <h2>My Background</h2>
                      <p> Hello! My name is Kyla Zhang, and I'm a current student at PCC. 
                        I love to learn and be social with my friends. 
                        I'm interested in computers and biology. 
                        <br><br>
                        Traveling is one of my favorite things to do, however packing for trips can be a pain.
                        Every year, my family and I go to China to visit my extended family, and it's always so much fun.
                        Last Christmas, my family and I took a trip to Florida and the Carribeans and it was easily my favorite trip ever.
                        I'm definitely looking forward to exploring more of the world.</p>
